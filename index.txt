Hi! Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Avery, a transfem nerd interested
in compiler design, systems administration, and all sorts of old Unix systems.
I'll probably occasionally talk about rollerblading, legos, or space. Check out
$/posts/ for what I've yapped about, or $/projects/ for what I'm working on.
